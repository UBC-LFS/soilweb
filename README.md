> You might have some CSS and Javascript issues because of deactivated plugins

## A. How to fix a website with CSS issues

When a website is broken for some reason such as jQuery and PHP updates, please use Global CSS code.

#### If a Custom CSS editor is activated

1. Activate a **Custom CSS** (Global CSS) under **Plugins** first
2. Copy and paste the CSS code into the global editor.

#### If a Custom CSS editor it not activated for some reason

1. Go to the **Customize** Under **Appearance** in the left navigation menu.
2. Copy and paste the CSS code into the **Additional CSS** editor.


## B. How to fix clicking events on the image with Javsacript issues

#### If a click event on the image is not working properly on the home page, it would be a Javascript issue

1. Activate a **Custom Javascripty Meta Box** (Local Javascript) under **Plugins** first
2. Check HTML code including **map** tags
2. Copy and paste **custom.js** code into the Local Javascript editor on the page


Thank you!
